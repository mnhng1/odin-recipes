<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This chicken cutlet rice bowl is absolutely incredible. Love at first taste, like we had with this Instant Pot Japanese curry too! Crispy, rich, comforting, flavor packed, these ingredients all go together perfectly.</p>
<p> And even better if you choose to use homemade Japanese curry roux (this recipe is SUPER easy). But don't worry, even if you use store bought, this chicken katsu donburi is perfection.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Chicken thighs - Chicken thighs are so much juicier and more flavorful than chicken breasts. However, you can substitute chicken breasts if desired. You can also use a pork cutlet if you prefer pork.</li>
    <li>Panko bread crumbs - Panko breadcrumbs add a light, airy, crisp texture to the chicken.</li>
    <li>Egg - used to dip the chicken in before coating with the bread crumbs.</li>
    <li>Onions, potatoes, carrots - These add substance to the curry. </li>
    <li>Japanese curry roux - a curry made with flour, butter, curry powder and garam masala. Make your own Japanese curry roux, or buy it from the store.</li>
    <li>Mirin - Used to add a slight sweetness to the curry sauce.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place 2-3 chicken thighs in a plastic bag, or between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and beat lightly with a mallet until about Â½" thick. Repeat for all chicken thighs.</li>
    <li>Heat cooking oil in a Dutch oven or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Combine the bread crumbs, flour, salt and pepper in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Dip the chicken thighs in the beaten egg, then dredge in panko bread crumbs and add to the oil. You should be able to fit 2-3 chicken thighs in each batch. </li>
    <li>Cook on each side about 3-5 minutes, until the bread crumbs are golden brown and chicken is cooked through. Repeat with all chicken.</li>
    <li>Slice the fried chicken into strips and serve with the curry gravy and steamed white rice.</li>
    
</ol>
<h2>How to Make Japanese Curry Gravy</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat and cook the onion until soft.</li>
    <li>Add the potatoes, carrots, water, stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until vegetables can be easily pierced with a fork.</li>
    <li>Add the curry roux, salt and mirin and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes, until the gravy has thickened. Add additional salt to taste if desired.</li>
</ol>
